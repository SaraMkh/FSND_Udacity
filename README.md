through my learning journey to a Udacity Nanodegree, I learn how to design and build databases for software applications, create and deploy database-backed web APIs, and secure and manage user authentication and access control for an application backend.

This is the public repository to reflect my effort to solve the  projects of Udacity's Full-Stack Nanodegree program.
